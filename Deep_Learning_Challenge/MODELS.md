Analysis of Neural Network Model 1
1. Data Preprocessing
The script begins by dropping non-beneficial ID columns (EIN and NAME) from application_df. This step helps remove irrelevant features that do not contribute to the model’s predictive power, ensuring more meaningful training data.
2. Model Architecture
The model is defined as a deep neural network using TensorFlow’s Sequential API, consisting of:
Input Features: Determined by len(X_train_scaled[0]), ensuring compatibility with scaled training data.
Hidden Layer 1: 10 neurons with a tanh activation function.
Hidden Layer 2: 5 neurons with a relu activation function.
Output Layer: 1 neuron with a relu activation function.
3. Analysis of Activation Functions
Tanh (Hidden Layer 1): This activation function helps capture complex relationships by mapping inputs between -1 and 1. It is useful for handling both positive and negative values in data.
ReLU (Hidden Layer 2 & Output): A common choice for hidden layers due to its efficiency in handling vanishing gradients. However, using relu in the output layer can be problematic since it does not allow negative outputs, which may not be suitable for some classification problems.

501 (All trainable)

The model is relatively small with only 501 trainable parameters, which suggests it may lack complexity for more intricate classification tasks.
5. Potential Improvements
Modify Output Activation: Instead of relu, using sigmoid (for binary classification) or softmax (for multi-class classification) would be more appropriate.
Increase Hidden Neurons: Expanding the hidden layers could improve feature extraction.
Add Regularization (Dropout or L2): Helps prevent overfitting.
Optimize Learning Rate: Adjusting learning rates dynamically (e.g., using Adam optimizer) could enhance convergence.

Analysis of Neural Network Model 2
1. Data Preprocessing
The script removes the EIN column, simplifying the dataset.
The NAME column is binned, reducing unique categories by grouping low-frequency values into "Other". This technique helps minimize model complexity while retaining relevant categorical information.
2. Model Architecture
This model introduces three hidden layers with:
128 neurons (ReLU) – Strong feature extraction.
64 neurons (Sigmoid) – Helps capture nonlinear relationships.
32 neurons (Sigmoid) – Further refines features.
The output layer uses Sigmoid, making it suitable for binary classification (success or failure).

Adam Optimizer (Automatically adjusts learning rates for better convergence).
Binary Crossentropy Loss (Best suited for classification).
Precision, Recall, Accuracy Metrics (Gives insight beyond basic accuracy).
4. Training & Performance
Improved Accuracy (76.2%) vs. Previous Model (~75%).
Precision (~72%) ensures low false positives.
High Recall (~88%) captures more true positives.
5. Potential Enhancements
Try Batch Normalization: Stabilizes activations.
Adjust Learning Rate: Fine-tune Adam optimizer settings.
Experiment with Different Activation Functions: The use of sigmoid in hidden layers could be replaced with relu or swish for potential improvements.



Analysis of Model 3 (Random Forest + Neural Network Hybrid)
1. Random Forest Model
This model begins with a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning method that:
Uses 200 estimators (trees) for robust decision-making.
Ranks feature importance to highlight variables with the highest predictive power.
Shows "ASK_AMT" as the most significant feature (strong impact on funding success).
Feature importance insights:
ASK_AMT contributes 34% to predictions.
AFFILIATION_CompanySponsored and NAME_Other hold 9% and 8% influence.
Some features have near-zero importance, making them ideal candidates for removal.
2. Deep Neural Network Architecture
Once low-importance features were dropped, the neural network was defined with:
10 neurons (ReLU) in the first hidden layer – Basic feature extraction.
8 neurons (Sigmoid) in the second hidden layer – Attempts nonlinear transformations.
6 neurons (Sigmoid) in the third hidden layer – Further refinement.
Sigmoid activation in the output layer – Suitable for binary classification.

This is a smaller model compared to Model 2 (~900 parameters vs. 19,969), which may impact its learning capacity.
3. Training Performance

Final Accuracy: ~75.8%
High Recall: ~90.5% (Excellent at capturing true positives)
Precision: ~71.6% (Moderate control over false positives)
4. Advantages & Drawbacks
✅ Combines feature selection with deep learning. ✅ Smaller model, potentially faster training. ✅ Strong recall suggests it captures relevant patterns well. ❌ Accuracy improvement over Model 2 is minimal (~75.8% vs. 76.2%). ❌ Feature selection via Random Forest may have removed useful variables. ❌ Sigmoid activation in hidden layers may limit gradient flow.
5. Possible Improvements
Test additional feature selection techniques (e.g., PCA for dimensionality reduction).
Consider deeper neural networks with more neurons in each layer.
Try advanced activations like Swish or Leaky ReLU for better information flow.
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning (learning rates, dropout, etc.).
